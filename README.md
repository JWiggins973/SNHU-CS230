This is my reflection and final project in this course

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for this assignment is the Gaming Room, which has requested the team to facilitate the development of their popular gaming app, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based, cross-platform version. In addition, the client requires the game to support both single and multi-team modes, where team games allow multiple players per team. All game and team names must be unique, and only one instance of the game should exist in memory at any given time.


#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The part of the documentation I excelled at was interpreting the client’s needs and translating them into clear and concise system requirements. I believe this is a crucial step in the process because any misinterpretation at this stage can lead to significant delays and unproductive time during development.


#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of creating the design document helped break down the project into a structured format, similar to pseudocode. It clearly outlined the client’s needs, constraints, and the team’s planned approach to implementation and project structure, including the use of a UML diagram.


#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I revised one part of the assignment, it would be the comparison of development requirements for Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile. Upon review, I noticed my evaluation leaned toward Apple and Linux due to my personal preferences. To improve this section and enhance future design documents, I could establish a guideline, such as listing three pros and three cons for each operating system (or any item being compared). This approach would ensure a more balanced and objective analysis.


#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs are translated into system requirements during the design phase to ensure the software or system aligns with the user’s expectations and goals. These requirements act as a blueprint, detailing the system’s functionality, performance, and constraints to guide development and ensure the final product meets the intended purpose.



#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach to designing software begins with thoroughly understanding the system requirements and constraints. The next step involves outlining the system architecture using tools like UML diagrams and breaking the project into smaller, manageable parts to streamline development and testing. Finally, selecting the appropriate tools and frameworks tailored to the project’s needs ensures an efficient and effective implementation.

In the future, adopting an agile methodology could enhance the process by incorporating continuous feedback, ensuring the product evolves to meet user needs. Additionally, leveraging model-driven designs would provide clearer visualization of system components and their interactions, further improving collaboration and design accuracy.
